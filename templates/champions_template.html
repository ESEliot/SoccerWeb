          <h4>The Soccer Field</h4>
          <p>there's no set field dimensions. Instead, soccer uses minimums and maximums allowing fields to fit within those dimensions.</p>

          <h4>The Ball</h4>
          <p>Soccer balls come in sizes the modern soccer ball is normally made with a plastic covering and is surprisingly light.</p>

          <h4>The Clock</h4>
          <p>At the highest level, the game lasts 90 minutes plus stoppage time. There are two halves of 45 minutes each and both end after stoppage time.</p>

          <h4>The Referee</h4>
          <p>There's normally one referee on the field who controls the whistle and the cards. Cards? Yep, cards. In soccer, punishment is doled out through the referee raising a yellow or red card. </p>

Unlike most sports, professional soccer has leagues all over the world. Under FIFA rules, most leagues have to be within a single country. Major League Soccer is an exception, allowed to field teams in the USA and Canada. England's league also allows clubs from Wales.</p>
